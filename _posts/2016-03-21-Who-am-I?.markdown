Hello World, my name is Diogo Antunes and you can find me at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DSwifting) or [Github](https://github.com/diogoAntunes). 

I'm a Telecommunications and Computer Engineer from Portugal, i love food, wine, tv shows and Swift! Swift is the best! Currently I'm an iOS developer at Bliss Applications, mostly just Swift (Obj-c is in the past).
I'm passionate about teaching and finding the best possible away to solve problems, as a result i created, with the help of my friend [John Mourato](https://twitter.com/_JARMourato), a place where we could teach Swift and best practices in general when working with the language. We called it [SwiftCamp](https://github.com/SwiftCamp).

It all started out as a way for us to teach our coworkers (who's past was mostly in the ObjectiveC land) some Swift. Initially we did some live talks about it, then we decided to launch a weekly issue [iOSwiftCamp](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/iOSwiftCamp), and finally we created a github account where we share playgrounds containing several exercises to practice Swift. 

My dream is to be a nomad developer, travel around the world, solve engineering problems, blog, and spent time with my family.

The goal of this website is to share my thoughts and discoveries in the iOS universe. Hope everyone has fun reading it as much as i have writting it.

Cheers

Diogo
